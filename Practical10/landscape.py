class Landscape:
    '''
     Basic landscape class.
     A single landscape object is made in the model, and all agents have a reference to it.
     The landscape has a reference to the array of agents created in the main 
     model class, so it can get each agent in turn and ask for its location.
     From this, it calculates a denisty map.
     In Model.py the map is then requested by each agent in turn, who uses the 
     densities to decide whether to move.
